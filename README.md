I am a human just like you!

Looking for solutions (hopefully in Python, but would accept others) to smooth out the voice in post-processing at the moment. Sample audio (.wav) can be found in the `samples` directory. 

Voice currently has this robotic feel to it. While looking into solutions to improve this on the network's side, or data input, I am wondering if anyone knows of a good method to fix it in post processing.
